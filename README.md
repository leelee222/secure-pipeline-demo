# 🚀 Secure Pipeline Demo

A hands-on project to build a **secure CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.
This repo is part of my **3-Month DevSecOps Journey**.

---

## 📅 Roadmap Progress

### ✅ Week 1 – CI/CD Security Basics

* [x] Setup Node.js/Python app repo
* [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD (build + test)
* [ ] SonarQube static analysis
* [ ] Trivy/Snyk dependency scanning
* [ ] GitLeaks secret detection
* [ ] Pipeline fails on vulnerabilities
* [ ] Document pipeline in README

---

### 🔄 Week 2 – Container Security *(in progress)*

* [ ] Dockerize the app with a secure Dockerfile
* [ ] Scan image with Trivy/Clair
* [ ] Fix vulnerabilities and harden image
* [ ] Push image to DockerHub
* [ ] Document Docker security practices

---

### 🔄 Week 3 – Pipeline Automation *(coming soon)*

* [ ] Connect CI/CD to Docker build
* [ ] Add automated tests before build
* [ ] Add automated security scans after build
* [ ] Configure pipeline to fail on vulnerabilities
* [ ] Deploy to Minikube

---

### 🔄 Week 4 – Mini Project *(planned)*

* [ ] Integrate all components (app + CI/CD + Docker + security)
* [ ] Test full workflow
* [ ] Write final README + diagrams
* [ ] Create short demo video
