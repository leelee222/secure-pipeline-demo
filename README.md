# üöÄ Secure Pipeline Demo

A hands-on project to build a **secure CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.
This repo is part of my **3-Month DevSecOps Journey**.

## Docker & Container Security

This project follows container security best practices:

### Image build
- Multi-stage build to keep dev artifacts out of the final image.
- Base image: `node:18-alpine` (minimal, small attack surface).
- Only production dependencies installed in runtime image (`NODE_ENV=production`).

### Runtime hardening
- App runs as a non-root user (`USER node`) to minimize privileges.
- `.dockerignore` excludes local artifacts: `node_modules`, `coverage`, `.git`.
- Port exposed: `3000` (configurable via `PORT` env var).

### Vulnerability scanning
- Images scanned with **Trivy** in CI for HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities.
- Dependencies scanned with **Snyk** / **Trivy FS** and `npm audit` locally.
- CI pipeline fails the build if HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities or secrets are detected.

### Signing & provenance
- Images are tagged with commit SHAs for immutability (`ilham/secure-pipeline-demo:<commit-sha>`).
- (Optional) Images can be signed with **cosign** to guarantee provenance.

### How to reproduce locally
```bash
# build
docker build -t ilham/secure-pipeline-demo:local .

# run
docker run -p 3000:3000 ilham/secure-pipeline-demo:local

# scan
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ilham/secure-pipeline-demo:local

---

# Quick troubleshooting & tips

- If Trivy finds issues in the **base image**, try upgrading to a newer base image (e.g., `node:18.20-alpine` or `node:20-alpine`).
- If vulnerabilities come from npm packages, prefer upgrading the specific package rather than `npm audit fix --force`.
- Re-run `trivy` after each fix until HIGH/CRITICAL are gone.
- Use pinned dependency versions in `package.json` (no `^`/`~` if you want strict reproducibility).
- For production deployment, use image scanning as a required gate (CI fails if vulnerability thresholds are exceeded).

If you want I can:
- produce the exact small change diff for your repo (Dockerfile + .dockerignore + workflow snippet),
- or generate a ready-to-copy `workflow` YAML you can drop into `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.

Which do you prefer ‚Äî **full file(s) ready to paste**, or **a git diff** you can apply?
